# Java Object Oriented Programming
Repositorio del sistema de agenda de citas

### What did I learned in this course?

I took what I learned in the basic java course and applied it to the regular OOP norms

I used my knowledge about variables, if, for loops, do whiles and while statments, you will 
notice there was a lot of scanner method usage for the terminal string capture.

### How is this repository structured?

This project is an simple appointment system that saves,"appointments" on a List<> method 
and displays them on the command line you can also query them based on the doctor.
